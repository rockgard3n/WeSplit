## WeSplit: Sharing the Bill with Ease!

Hey there!  This is my submission for the WeSplit project from the 100 Days of SwiftUI challenge. Remember those awkward moments of splitting a restaurant bill with friends?  Well, fret no more!  WeSplit is here to save the day (and your friendships)!

### Sharing Made Simple:

This app simplifies splitting bills amongst friends with its intuitive interface and powerful features:

* **Effortless Input:** Easily enter the bill amount and number of people.
* **Customizable Tip:** Add a tip percentage or a fixed amount to the total.
* **Equal or Individual:** Choose equal split or enter individual amounts for each person.
* **Clear Breakdown:** See a detailed breakdown of each person's share, including tip.
* **Expense Tracker (Optional):** Track past splits and manage group expenses (not included in this base version).

### My SwiftUI Journey:

WeSplit was a fantastic opportunity to solidify my understanding of SwiftUI, especially in:

* Working with forms and user input
* Implementing calculations and conditional logic
* Formatting and displaying data clearly
* Building reusable UI components

This project definitely had its challenges, but overcoming them was incredibly rewarding.  I learned the importance of:

* Planning and structuring the code effectively
* Debugging efficiently and using resources wisely
* Testing different user flows and iterating on the design

### Get Splitting!

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project file in Xcode 14+.
3. Run the app and start splitting bills like a pro!

### Room for More:

While this version focuses on the core functionality, there's always room for growth!  Try implementing:

* Currency selection and conversion
* Splitting by item cost instead of equally
* Integration with payment apps

### A Big Thank You!

A huge shout-out to the 100 Days of SwiftUI community for the guidance and inspiration!  This project wouldn't be possible without all the amazing contributors and learners.

I hope you enjoy using WeSplit as much as I enjoyed creating it! Feel free to share your feedback and let's keep improving the bill-splitting experience together!
